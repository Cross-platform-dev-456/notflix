# ðŸ“œ Team Rules â€“ Notflix Project

## 1. Communication

* We will use **Discord** as our primary channel for communication.
* Everyone must check messages at least **once per day** and respond to direct questions within **24 hours**.
* Urgent issues will be flagged with `@everyone` or marked as urgent in the channel.

## 2. Meetings

* Weekly team meeting will be held on **Mondays at 3:50** (Zoom or in-person).
* All members must submit their weekly progress **24 hours before** the meeting.
* If you cannot attend, notify the leader and team **at least 24 hours in advance**.

## 3. Work & Contributions

* Each member is responsible for at least **one feature** and its **requirements**.
* Contributions must be documented (LoC, features completed, requirements finished) in weekly updates.
* Members must write **unit tests** for their code and help with integration/regression testing.

## 4. GitHub Rules

* We will use **one shared repo**: \[GitHub Repo Link].
* **Workflow**:

  1. Create a new branch for each feature or bugfix (`feature/login`, `fix/auth-header`, etc.).
  2. Push changes to your branch and open a **pull request (PR)**.
  3. At least **one reviewer** (peer or leader) must approve before merging.
  4. No direct commits to `main` without review.
* PR descriptions must explain the purpose of the change and reference the requirement/feature it addresses.

## 5. Documentation

* All documentation will be placed in the `docs/` folder at the root of the repo.
* Use **Markdown** for all documents.
* **Required docs**:

  * User Manual (Marp â†’ PDF)
  * Architecture/Design Doc (Marp â†’ PDF)
  * Weekly Progress Reports (Markdown)
* Weekly progress reports will be compiled by the leader and published on GitHub & Canvas.
* Members must document their own contributions (code comments, updates in `docs/`, or progress notes).

## 6. Deadlines & Accountability

* Each requirement will have a deadline; members must complete tasks on time.
* If a member cannot meet a deadline, they must inform the leader and team **before the due date**.
* Missed deadlines without communication may lead to reduced credit in peer evaluation.

## 7. Professionalism

* All members must act respectfully and professionally in communication.
* Constructive feedback is encouraged, but no negative or hostile behavior will be tolerated.
* Decisions are made by team discussion; if unresolved, the leader makes the final call.

## 8. Consequences

* **First violation**: Verbal reminder from the leader.
* **Second violation**: Issue noted in peer evaluation.
* **Third violation**: Reported to professor for further action.
